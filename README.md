# PDF-Query-RAG-With-LangChain-And-AstraDB-GenAI-Project
This Repository contains my working files on "PDF Query RAG With LangChain And AstraDB", an GenAI Project

(i) Developed an end-to-end PDF Query Application using LangChain integrated with Cassandra DB (AstraDB) for scalable vector-based search.

(ii) Implemented PDF reading and text chunking using PyPDF2 and LangChainâ€™s CharacterTextSplitter to manage token size and context overlap.

(iii) Converted PDF chunks into embeddings using OpenAI embeddings for efficient similarity search and retrieval.

(iv) Stored embeddings in Cassandra DB (AstraDB) to handle large documents with high scalability and availability, enabling persistent vector storage.

(v) Built an interactive query interface that allows users to ask questions about the PDF content, retrieving relevant information using vector similarity search.
